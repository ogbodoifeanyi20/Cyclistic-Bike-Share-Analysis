# Project * Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Analysis
**Author:** Ifeanyi Joseph
**GitHub Username:** ogbodoifeanyi20
**Tools Used:** Excel | Power Query | Power BI
## Objective** To Analyze Cyclistic bike-share data to understand how member and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
##Data Preparation**- Imported and cleaned trip data using **Power Query**
- Replaced inconsistent text values (e.g., ‚Äúelectric_bike‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúelectric bike‚Äù)
- Removed null and duplicate rows
- Standardized date and time formats
- Calculated trip **distance**, **speed**, and **duration**
##Analytical Insight**														
-The table measures aggregate performance (derived from speed, distance, and duration).														
-From this:														
-Members outperform casual riders across all bike types.														
-Docked bikes generate higher total performance, especially among members.														
-The electric bike advantage is visible for casual riders (slightly higher than docked), and on the average speed and distance for member riders														
-Casual riders take shorter but slower trips than members.														
-They prefer electric bikes more than docked bikes.														
-Members ride faster, longer, and more frequently
## Dashboard Features
- Average trip distance, speed, and duration by rider type  
- Monthly ride trends and performance metrics    
- Slicers for flexible filtering
## Recommendations**
# Casual riders would buy Cyclistic memberships if they realize that:							
    -Memberships save them money on frequent or long rides,							
    -They have convenience and flexibility on (no per-ride payment),							
    -embers get priority access and electric bike benefits/discounts						
 **digital marketing** to convert active casual riders to membership
