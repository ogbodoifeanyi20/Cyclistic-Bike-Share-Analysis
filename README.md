# Project: üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Cyclistic Ride Performance Analysis

# Overview: 
This project analyzes Cyclistic bike-share data to understand how casual riders and monthly members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
The insights help the company design strategies to convert casual riders into full members and improve overall service efficiency.

# Project Objectives: 
To compare usage patterns between casual riders and members
To identify peak riding hours, most popular bike types, and ride durations.
To analyze average speed, distance, and trip performance index per rider category.
To develop an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize rider behavior and performance metrics.
Provide data-driven recommendations to increase membership conversion.

# Tools Used and Steps: 
Source data-CSV / Excel Dataset ( A Google Data Analytics Capstone);
Excel Power Query-Data cleaning and transformation;
Excel - Analysis; calculations, Pivot table and chats;
Power BI-Dashboard creation and visualization.

# Insights: 
Member riders record higher overall trip performance (574,395) than casual riders (205,435).
Electric bikes are the most preferred type among both rider categories.
Casual riders are more active on weekends, while members ride more on weekdays.
Average speed and distance are significantly higher among members due to consistent usage patterns.

# Dataset:
Source: Cyclistic bike-share trip data (CSV format);
Fields: Rider Type, Bike Type, Distance, Duration, Speed, Start/End Time, Ride ID, Station/station ID, coordinate of points (Latitude/Longitude)
Period: October 1st ‚Äì 31st, 2020.

# Dashboard Features:
Average trip distance, speed, and duration by rider type,  
Monthly ride trends and performance metrics,    
Slicers for flexible filtering.
														
# Recommendations:
Offer discounted memberships to frequent casual riders who complete multiple trips per month.
Promote electric bikes as premium options for convenience and speed.
Introduce digital campaigns to convert weekend riders into subscribed members.
Casual riders would buy Cyclistic memberships if they realize that:							
Memberships save them money on frequent and  long distance rides,							
members get priority access and electric bike benefits/discounts
